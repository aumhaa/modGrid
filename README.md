# modGrid
Max and Python support for modGrid beta .2

Built against Live 10.2.10.
Add the folders from Python Scripts (aumhaa, modGrid) to your Ableton User Libraries Remote Scripts folder (you may need to create it).  
Normally, this will be at ~/Music/Ableton/User Library/Remote Scripts/.  If you've set a custom path, you should be able to find the correct location by looking in Ableton's file settings. 



Documentation for modGrid app forthcoming...
